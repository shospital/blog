# It must have been Love

Lay a whisper on my pillow

Leave the winter on the ground

I wake up lonely, there's air of silence

In the bedroom and all around


Touch me now, I close my eyes

And dream away


It must have been love but it's over now

It must have been good but I lost it somehow

It must have been love but it's over now

From the moment we touched till the time had run out



Make believing we're together

That I'm sheltered by your heart

But in and outside, I turned to water

Like a teardrop in your palm



And it's a hard winter's day

I dream away


It must have been love but it's over now

It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without

It must have been love but it's over now

It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows



It must have been love but it's over now

It must have been good but I lost it somehow

It must have been love but it's over now

From the moment we touched till the time had run out



Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now

It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without

It must have been love but it's over now

It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows



It must have been love but it's over now

It must have been love but it's over now


# Thinking Outloud

When your legs don't work like they used to before

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe just the touch of a hand

Oh me I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm

I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen

Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe it's all part of a plan

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are, oh

So baby now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are

Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)

And we found love right where we are

# Midnight Blue

Midnight blue so lonely without you

Dreams fed by the memories

Oh let the music play

Midnight blue those treasured thoughts of you

Gone now and forever

Please

Let the music play

Midnight

Midnight

I forgave you

Couldn't save you

Drove you from my mind

Midnight blue - so lonely without you

Warm words from a fantasy

Oh let the music play

Midnight blue - the tears come flowing through

I'll never forget you

Please

Let the music play

Midnight

Midnight

Midnight blue those treasured thoughts of you

Gone now and forever please

Let the music play
