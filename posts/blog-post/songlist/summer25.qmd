# Say You Say Me

Say you, say me

Say it for always

That's the way it should be

Say you, say me

Say it together, naturally

I had a dream, I had an awesome dream

People in the park playing games in the dark

And what they played was a masquerade

And from behind the walls of doubt

A voice was crying out

Say you, say me

Say it for always

That's the way it should be

Say you, say me

Say it together, naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway

Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two

That helping hand

Someone who understands

That when you feel you've lost your way

You've got someone there to say, "I'll show you"

Say you, say me

Say it for always (oh)

That's the way it should be

Say you, say me

Say it together, naturally

So you think you know the answers? Oh no

Well the whole world's got you dancing

That's right, I'm telling you

Time to start believing, oh yes

Believe in who you are

You are a shining star

Say you, say me

Say it for always

Oh, that's the way it should be

Say you, say me

Say it together, naturally

Say it together, naturally

# All Of Me

[Verse 1]
All of me, why not take all of me?

Can't you see I'm no good without you?

Take my lips, I want to lose them

Take my arms, I'll never use them

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry

How can I go on, dear, without you?

You took the part that once was my heart

So why not take all of me?

[Verse 2]
All of me, why not take all of me?

Can't you see I'm no good without you?

Take my lips, I want to lose them

Take my arms, I'll never use them

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry

How can I go on, dear, without you?

You took the best so why not take the rest?

Baby, take all of me

# You Say


I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough

Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up

Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?

Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know

Ooh-oh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing

You say I am strong when I think I am weak

And you say I am held when I am falling short

And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours

And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)

What You say of me (I)

I believe

The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me

In You, I find my worth, in You, I find my identity

Ooh-oh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing

You say I am strong when I think I am weak

And you say I am held when I am falling short

When I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours

And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)

What You say of me (I)

Oh, I believe

Taking all I have, and now I'm laying it at Your feet

You have every failure, God, You have every victory

Ooh-oh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing

You say I am strong when I think I am weak

You say I am held when I am falling short

When I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours

And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)

What You say of me (I)

I believe

Oh, I believe (I)

Yes, I believe (I)

What You say of me (I)

I believe


# Flowers

We were good, we were gold

Kinda dream that can't be sold

We were right 'til we weren't

Built a home and watched it burn

Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie

Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing

And I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Paint my nails cherry red

Match the roses that you left

No remorse, no regret

I forgive every word you said

Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours, yeah

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing, yeah

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I- (ooh, I)

I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers (uh-huh)

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours (yeah)

Say things you don't understand (you never will)

I can take myself dancing, yeah

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than

Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (oh, oh)

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (than you can)

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I-

# How Deep Is Your Love


I know your eyes in the morning sun

I feel you touch me in the pouring rain

And the moment that you wander far from me

I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze

Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

I really mean to learn

'Cause we're living in a world of fools

Breaking us down when they all should let us be

We belong to you and me

I believe in you

You know the door to my very soul

You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour

You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think I care for you

When you know down inside that I really do

And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

I really mean to learn

'Cause we're living in a world of fools

Breaking us down when they all should let us be

We belong to you and me

Na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

And you come to me on a summer breeze

Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

I really mean to learn

'Cause we're living in a world of fools

Breaking us down when they all should let us be

We belong to you and me (na-na-na-na-na)

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

I really mean to learn

'Cause we're living in a world of fools

Breaking us down when they all should let us be

We belong to you and me (na-na-na-na-na)

How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?

I really mean to learn

'Cause we're living in a world of fools

Breaking us down when they all should let us be

We belong to you and me

# Words (Beegees)

Smile an everlasting smile

A smile can bring you near to me

Don't ever let me find you down

'Cause that would bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory

Let's start a brand new story now, my love

Right now, there'll be no other time

And I can show you how, my love

Talk in everlasting words

And dedicate them all to me

And I will give you all my life

I'm here if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean

A single word I say

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away

You think that I don't even mean

A single word I say

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away



# Words (F.R. David)

[Chorus]

Words don't come easy to me

How can I find a way to make you see I love you?

Words don't come easy

Words don't come easy to me

This is the only way for me to say I love you

Words don't come easy

[Verse 1]

Well, I'm just a music man, melodies are so far my best friend

But my words are coming out wrong, girl, I reveal my heart to you

And hope that you believe it's true 'cause


[Chorus]

Words don't come easy to me

How can I find a way to make you see I love you?

Words don't come easy


[Verse 2]

This is just a simple song that I've made for you on my own

There's no hidden meaning you know when I, when I say I love you, honey

Please believe, I really do 'cause

[Chorus]

Words don't come easy to me

How can I find a way to make you see I love you?

Words don't come easy

# Over and Over

I never dare to reach for the moon

I never thought I'd know heaven so soon

I couldn't hope to say how I feel

The joy in my heart no words can reveal

[REFRAIN]

Over and over I whisper your name

Over and over I kiss you again

I see the light of love in your eyes

Love is forever,no more good-byes

Now just a memory the tears that I cried

Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed

Dreams that I cherished all have come true

All my tomorrows I give to you


Life's summer leaves may turn into gold

The love that we share will never grow old

Here in your arms no words far away

Her in your arms forever I'll stay

Refrain twice

Lai...la...la...lai
