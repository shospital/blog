# Words (Beegees)

Smile an everlasting smile

A smile can bring you near to me

Don't ever let me find you down

'Cause that would bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory

Let's start a brand new story now, my love

Right now, there'll be no other time

And I can show you how, my love

Talk in everlasting words

And dedicate them all to me

And I will give you all my life

I'm here if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean

A single word I say

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away

You think that I don't even mean

A single word I say

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away

It's only words and words are all I have

To take your heart away



# Words (F.R. David)

[Chorus]

Words don't come easy to me

How can I find a way to make you see I love you?

Words don't come easy

Words don't come easy to me

This is the only way for me to say I love you

Words don't come easy

[Verse 1]

Well, I'm just a music man, melodies are so far my best friend

But my words are coming out wrong, girl, I reveal my heart to you

And hope that you believe it's true 'cause


[Chorus]

Words don't come easy to me

How can I find a way to make you see I love you?

Words don't come easy


[Verse 2]

This is just a simple song that I've made for you on my own

There's no hidden meaning you know when I, when I say I love you, honey

Please believe, I really do 'cause

[Chorus]

Words don't come easy to me

How can I find a way to make you see I love you?

Words don't come easy

# Over and Over

I never dare to reach for the moon

I never thought I'd know heaven so soon

I couldn't hope to say how I feel

The joy in my heart no words can reveal

[REFRAIN]

Over and over I whisper your name

Over and over I kiss you again

I see the light of love in your eyes

Love is forever,no more good-byes

Now just a memory the tears that I cried

Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed

Dreams that I cherished all have come true

All my tomorrows I give to you


Life's summer leaves may turn into gold

The love that we share will never grow old

Here in your arms no words far away

Her in your arms forever I'll stay

Refrain twice

Lai...la...la...lai

# Hard To Say I'm Sorry

"Everybody needs a little time away"

I heard her say, from each other

Even lovers need a holiday

Far away, from each other


[Pre-Chorus: All]

Hold me now

It's hard for me to say I'm sorry

I just want you to stay

[Chorus: All]

After all that we've been through

I will make it up to you, I promise to

And after all that's been said and done

You're just the part of me I can't let go


Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body

Wouldn't want to be swept away

Far away, from the one that I love


[Pre-Chorus: All]

Hold me now

It's hard for me to say I'm sorry

I just want you to know

Hold me now

I really want to tell you I'm sorry

I could never let you go

# You Are Only Lonely

When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders

And, when you're feeling lonely and small,

You need somebody there to hold you;

You can call out my name

When you're only lonely;

Now, don't you ever be ashamed;

You're only lonely.

When you need somebody around on the nights that try you

I was there when you were a queen

And I'll be the last one there beside you;

So you can call out my name

When you're only lonely;

Now, don't you ever be ashamed;

You're only lonely. (You're only lonely)

(You're only lonely) (You're only lonely)

Ooh, When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders

And, when you're feeling lonely and small,

You need somebody there to hold you;

So don't you ever be ashamed

When you're only lonely;

You can call out my name

When you're only lonely; (You're only lonely)

When you're only lonely; (You're only lonely)

Ooh, it's no crime,

Darlin', we got lots of time,

Woh, woh, (You're only lonely)

Woh, woh, woh, (You're only lonely)

No there's nothing wrong with you,

Darlin, I get lonely too.

(You're only lonely)(You're only lonely)

So, if you need me, (You're only lonely)

All you've gotta do is call me

Well, you're only lonely

(You're only lonely)(You're only lonely)

Ooh, ooh, (You're only lonely)

# Time In A Bottle


If I could save time in a bottle

The first thing that I'd like to do

Is to save every day

'Til eternity passes away

Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever

If words could make wishes come true

I'd save every day like a treasure and then

Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time

To do the things you want to do

Once you find them

I've looked around enough to know

That you're the one I want to go

Through time with

If I had a box just for wishes

And dreams that had never come true

The box would be empty

Except for the memory

Of how they were answered by you

But there never seems to be enough time

To do the things you want to do

Once you find them

I've looked around enough to know

That you're the one I want to go

Through time with

# Perfect

I found a love for me

Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead

Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet

Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was

I will not give you up this time

Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own

And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song

When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath

But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home

I found a love to carry more than just my secrets

To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds

I know we'll be alright this time

Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man

I see my future in your eyes

Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song

When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful

I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

Mm, oh

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song

I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met

An angel in person, and she looks perfect

Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight
