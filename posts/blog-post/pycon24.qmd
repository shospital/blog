PyCon Estonia 2024: Three Level Programming by Raymond Hettinger
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__qQGdupxM

* LLM provides codes but they take in good and bad codes 
and it will be our jobs to evaluate.
* You need to get a level of programming and ways are from "enjoying programming", or talk to people who enjoy, or go to conferences.
* LLM go to stack overflow. 
* Winning marraige. what's the performance implication and on demand, acquire the knowledge as you go.

## High Level - The program domain
-  if you get into programming and thinking about programming ways and write it. skills but it's not the best. 

__force the problem into the machine__.  thinking into the program is not what LLM is good at.  Approach the problem from the top down. Solutions from the problem domain.

## Examples
### Recongnize bad code 

If if you look under the hood, it may be using forloop and mistakenly you are calling for loop inside for loop in various methods/functions.  __Ask LLM__

### Causal Inference

Confounding association (wine drinking is healthy, not.)
__Design code like causal inference.__

### Take away
What is this function made up of,
