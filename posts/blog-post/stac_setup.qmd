# Setting up stac-fastapi with postgresql locally

With the stac-fastapi-pgstac, I was able to create STAC API.

* STAC Catalog (root) was automatically provided by the API.
* Collections - created IMS 1k sea ice collection using my STACManager class.
* Items - added items to the collection by first accessing the files from s3 bucket to get the metadata then to create items using STACManager class.

# Query and load data with xarray
