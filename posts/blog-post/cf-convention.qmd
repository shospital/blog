## Time variable

  * must include units ([see format](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#time-coordinate-units))
  * has no default value
 * time coordinate and the datetime are interconvertible given the calendar
* must comprise units of measure, "since", and a reference datetime. ("days sinced 1990-01-01")
   * acceptable unit of measures (day (h), hour (hr, h), minute (min), and second (sec, s). Plurals are acceptable
* leap seconds should be properly dealt but often not the case.  If using standard, proleptic_gregorian, and julian for calenar,
one can add units_metadata to indicate "leap_seconds"

### time units

```
double time(time) ;
  time:axis = "T"; // optional
  time:standard_name = "time" ; // optional
  time:units = "days since 1990-1-1 0:0:0" ; // mandatory
```

Example of how adding leap second information

```
  float time_stdnone ;
    time_stdnone:standard_name = "time" ;
    time_stdnone:long_name = "Model data with no leap seconds" ;
    time_stdnone:calendar = "standard" ;
    time_stdnone:units = "seconds since 2016-12-31 23:59:58" ;
    time_stdnone:units_metadata = "leap_seconds: none" ;
  float time_stdutc ;
    time_stdutc:standard_name = "time" ;
    time_stdutc:long_name = "Model data with leap seconds or obs data with accurate UTC" ;
    time_stdutc:calendar = "standard" ;
    time_stdutc:units = "seconds since 2016-12-31 23:59:58" ;
    time_stdutc:units_metadata = "leap_seconds: utc" ;
```

## Time Calendar

* CF calendar refers to datetime, not just date.
* calendar standard: default UDUNITS.  A **deprecated** alternative name is gregorian. 
* other calendar categories are proleptic_gregorian, julian, and utc. Read more at [cf-convention](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#leap-seconds)
