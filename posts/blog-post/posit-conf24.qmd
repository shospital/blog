This was my first Posit Conference, and I was eager to learn about new technologies and tools. 
Interestingly, what I enjoyed most were the keynotes and the spontaneous conversations during breaks.

The keynote speakers were inspirational, offering a big-picture perspective and motivations 
for pursuing a meaningful career path. 
The impromptu discussions with conference attendeesâ€”who came from diverse backgrounds gave me valuable insights, 
not just in data science, but in life.

Having had this wonderful opportunity to attend, I'd like to share a few key takeways. This blog isn't about the specific
topics covered in the conference session, but rather about what I took away from the overall experience.

## Keynote take-away 

At times work can settle into comfortable routines or become a pursuit of intellectual satisfaction.
While goals and objectives guide our work and shape our workflows, I sometimes reflect on how I can make my work more 
meaningful. 

* Ask the key question: How can we be innovative to make things better?
* Whatever I do, aim to contribute--even in small ways--to creating positive change.
* Create Virtuous cycles to benefit everyone involved.

* Open Science: Use data to understand the world better. Then we know how to make the world better 
* Negative bias is a serious threat tot our well being and ability to address the problems we face 

* Working with people from different background can be challenging.   
Agree on a set of core values such as radical transparency, trust, respect, courage, commitment

* ChatGPT is becoming widely used especially among the new generation of professionals.  Asking for a code sample is no longer as relevant. 
What does the future hold? perhpas it lies with those who can ask the "right" questions to solve difficult problems. 


## Key Statiscal and Machine Learning tools
* __`{marginaleffects}`__ package for model comparisons. you write a comparison function 
and the package help to generate ggplot and other output to compare models.
* __Prediction Intervals__: github.com/brshallo/posit-2024, talked about different ways to construct and evaluate 
prediction intervals
    * Interval width is widely used and good to evaluate if a model is improving as the width becomes narrow. (Constant variance desired)
    * in Conformed prediction, the assumption is relaxed, and you compute upper and lower bands. (manokhin molar).  Use train, calibration, and test datasets for estimating intervals.

* __Deep learning__: `{keras3}` allows the use of keras and tensorflow in python throough `reticulate`.  
    * create neural network architecture just like python keras.
    * offers the interface to GPU. 
    * save the models in *.keras to change the backend for different cycles. (save and read model)
    * distributed training
    * keras3.posit.co 

*__Avoid garbage in/garbage out__: Use interactive tool like shiny for data cleaning


## Tools to check out

* __Web/Report publishing__ : Quarto Dashboard for web dashboard and quarto PDF using typst (faster than latex) 
* __Education/Training__ : WebR/Quarto live for interactive web interface with programming language, ideal for training.  It can be either a standalone web application 
or a code chunk in a quarto document. 
* __Cloud Computing__: Posit Workbench is a cloud computing and it handles infrastrcuture manageement and security requirements. It can be deployed in Posit:Connect.
* __Cloud and Collaboration__: Github codespace for computing and sharing simultaneously and is free for # of hours and you can use docker image to set a virtual environment. 
* __`{pins}`__: customizing and automating report generation and delivery
