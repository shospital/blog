 ## What is Iterator in Python

an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over a collection of data and returns 
one item at a time and keeps track of the current state.

## What Is the Python Iterator Protocol?
While there are iterator objects, you can also create iterator for your custom class by implementing two special methods called iterator protocol.

```.__iter__()``` to intialize the iterator and return an interator object (self)
```.__next__()``` to iterate over iterator and will return the next value  and raise an except ```StopIteration``` for the end of the collection.
