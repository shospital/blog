## What is Coordinate System?

A **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** is a framework used to represent the locations of geographic features, imagery, or observations. It enables spatial data to be accurately positioned and interpreted in relation to the Earth.


**Each CRS** is defined by the following elements:

1. **Measurement Framework**

    * Geographic: Coordinates measured on a spherical or ellipsoidal surface (latitude and longitude, referenced to the Earth’s center).
    * Projected: Coordinates projected onto a two-dimensional (planar) surface, typically using a mathematical transformation (map projection).

2. **Unit of Measurement**

    * Geographic CRS: Uses decimal degrees for latitude and longitude.
    * Projected CRS: Uses linear units such as meters or feet.

3.  **Map Projection Definition (for Projected CRS)**

    * Specifies how the three-dimensional surface of the Earth is translated onto a two-dimensional plane. This includes the mathematical projection method and its parameters.

4. **Other System Properties**

    * Includes the reference ellipsoid (spheroid), geodetic datum, and projection parameters such as standard parallels, central meridian, and false easting/northing (x and y shifts).

## Types of Coordinate System

There are **two common types**:

**Geographic Coordinate Reference System (Geographic CRS)**

A Geographic CRS uses latitude and longitude to specify locations on the Earth's surface, referencing positions on a three-dimensional spherical or ellipsoidal model of the planet. It is defined by:

* An angular unit of measurement: Typically degrees for both latitude and longitude.
* A prime meridian: The zero-longitude line from which other longitudes are measured (commonly the Greenwich Meridian).
* A geodetic datum: A mathematical model of the Earth's shape (based on a spheroid or ellipsoid) that provides a frame of reference for the coordinates.

**Projected Coordinate Reference System (Projected CRS)**

A Projected CRS transforms the Earth's curved surface (as defined by a geographic CRS) onto a flat, two-dimensional Cartesian plane using a map projection. Every projected CRS is based on an underlying geographic CRS (including its datum and spheroid). Locations in a projected CRS are identified by:

* X and Y coordinates: These represent positions on a grid, measured in linear units (such as meters or feet).
* Grid origin: The origin (0,0) of the coordinate system, which may or may not be at the center of the projection area, depending on the specific projection parameters chosen.



::: {.callout-note title="Cartesian Coordinate Plane"}
A Cartesian plane assumes:

1. Right-angle (orthogonal) x and y axes
2. Uniform scale throughout the plane
3. Locations are measured relative to an origin (0,0)

## Shape of the Earth (geodesy)

_Concept of Spheroid and Datum_

* **Spheroid** is a shape that approximates the shape of the earth.

* **Datum** is a mathematical model that defines the position of the spheroid relative to the center of the Earth. Datum describes how coordiate system is alligned with the Earth.

* There are two main types of Datum
    * Geodetic (or geographic) datum : defines origin and orientation of latitude and longitude.
    * Vertical datum : defines elevation or depth (sea level)

* Datum includes 2 things: __A Spheroid and Reference Point__

* Locations CRS changes depending on which datum and spheroid are used to describe locations.


## Three Main Datums

Basically each datum has slightly different shape of the earth ellipsoid and the reference point.


| **Datum** | **Spheroid** | **Semi-major axis (m)** | **Flattening**         | **Reference Point** | **Notes**                                                         |
|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WGS84** | WGS84 Ellipsoid                    | 6,378,137.0              | 1/298.257223563        | Earth’s center of mass        |  Standard for GPS                          |
| **NAD83** | GRS80 Ellipsoid                    | 6,378,137.0              | 1/298.257222101        | Earth’s center of mass        |  Used for US/Canada; similar to WGS84, not identical.              |
| **NAD27** | Clarke 1866 Ellipsoid              | 6,378,206.4              | 1/294.9786982          | Meades Ranch, Kansas, USA     |  Local reference; older maps.                  |
