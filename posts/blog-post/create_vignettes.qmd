This is my learning journey from [https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html).

The summary note of the regexcite package creation, go to [Create R Package page](create_r_package.html).

```
# create package will create a basic dir structure
usethis::create_package("~/regexcite")
```

The workflow to create vignettes.

```
use_vignettes() # to create a directory and update desc and .gitignore
load_all()
library('my-package')
```
