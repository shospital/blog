It’s important to agree on a set of core values, such as radical transparency, trust, respect, courage, and commitment.\nChatGPT is becoming widely used, especially among the new generation of professionals. Traditional software engineering interviews often involve requesting code samples, but this practice is becoming less relevant as many candidates now use ChatGPT. What does the future hold? Perhaps it lies with those who can construct the “right” questions to solve difficult problems."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Article: Validation of machine learning ridge regression models using Monte Carlo, bootstrap, and variations in cross-validation Link to the article\nThe article compares performance of the commonly used resampling techniques in machine/statistical learning using ridge regression models. There are many conflicting suggestions for methods and parameter values for fine tuning hyper parameters.\nUsing simulations, the author tries to answer the following questions:\n\nWhich of the four resampling methods is most effective in selecting a suitable regulatiziation paremter \\(\\lambda\\)?\nDoes increasing the number of repetitions - from 10 to 50 - improve the performance of the resampling method?\nKeeping the number of repetitions constant, which approach, single-run cross-validation or repated cross-validation, performs better?\nFor k=fold CV, what is an appropriate fold size k?\nWhich randomization approach is more effective, Monte Carlo (sampling without replacement) or bootstrap (with replacement)?\n\n\nRidge regression model\nIn regression model where Y is the target (response) variable and X_1, X_2, ..XP are feature (independent) variables, our goal is to find _beta coefficients that minimize the SSE in OLS. Linear model could have an overfitting problem.\nTo deal with overfitting issue in linear models, the ridge regression model was used to apply regularization. The penality term was added to the SSE equation.\n\\[\n\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} ({\\beta}_j^2)\n\\]\nThe ridge regression model and MSE are used to find the lambda estimate. Data set is split into a training and validation sets where training set is used for parameter estimation and the validation set for evaluating overfit. One split of a dataset could create bias in MSE thus resampling methods are used to obtain MSE estimates.\nRegularization results in shiriking the \\(\\beta_j\\) toward 0 as \\(\\lambda\\) becomes large (or \\(\\beta\\) is same when \\(\\lambda\\) =0).\n\n\nResampling methods\n\nMonte Carlo\n(Other names: repeated learning-testing, repeated holdout, random subsampling)\nMonte Carlo sampling randomly shuffles the dataset (randomizing rows) and select the first 75% to be a training set and the remaining 25% as a validation set. This is sampling without replacement.\nThe validation error is averaged over n repetitions.\n\n\nBootstrap\nSimilar to Monte Carlo sampling where data are randomly selected from the dataset but with replacement.\nThe validation error is averaged over n repetitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSunnys note\n\n\n\ncommonly (or by default) equal sampling probability?\n\n\n\n\nk-fold CV (Cross-validation)\nA dataset is divided into k partition at random (most commonly k=5 or 10). One partition is held out (set aside) as a validation set, and the remaining k-1 partitions of data are used as a training set. __The validation error_ is averaged over k repetitions.\nMost extreme case of k-fold CV, known as LOOCV (Leave One Out CV) is k = n where 1 observation is held out at each iteration.\n\n\nrepeated k-fold CV\nk-fold CV is done over n repetition and obtain \\({n} x {k}\\) validation errors.\nThe validation error is averaged over \\({n} \\times {k}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nmost commonly use k=fold CV only once (rep =1) and repeated method is suggested as a way of obtaining more accurate and reliable estimates of error rates"

forever?\nWherever you go\nWhatever you do\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWhatever it takes\nOr how my heart breaks\nI will be right here waiting for you\nI took for granted, all the times\nThat I thought would last somehow\nI hear the laughter, I taste the tears\nBut I can’t get near you now\nOh, can’t you see it, baby?\nYou’ve got me going crazy\nWherever you go\nWhatever you do\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWhatever it takes\nOr how my heart breaks\nI will be right here waiting for you\nI wonder how we can survive\nThis romance\nBut in the end if I’m with you\nI’ll take the chance\nOh, can’t you see it, baby?\nYou’ve got me going crazy\nWherever you go\nWhatever you do\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWhatever it takes\nOr how my heart breaks\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWaiting for you\n\n\nSorry you are only lonely\n[Verse 1]\nWhen the world is ready to fall\nOn your little shoulders\nAnd when you’re feeling lonely and small\nYou need somebody there to hold you\n[Chorus]\nYou can call out my name\nWhen you’re only lonely\nNow don’t you ever be ashamed\nYou’re only lonely\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you need somebody around\nOn the nights that try you\nRemember, I was there when you were a queen\nAnd I’ll be the last one there beside you\n[Chorus]\nSo you can call out my name\nWhen you’re only lonely\nNow don’t you ever be

scene from a movie that every broken heart knows\nWe were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close\nSplit second and you disappeared and then I was all alone\nI woke up in tears with you by my side\nA breath of relief, and I realized\nNo, we’re not promised tomorrow\nSo I’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you\nI’m gonna hold you like I’m saying goodbye\nWherever we’re standing, I won’t take you for granted\n’Cause we’ll never know when, when we’ll run out of time\nSo I’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you (lose you)\nI’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you\nIn the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke\nYou could lose everything, the truth is you never know\nSo I’ll kiss you longer, baby (hey), any chance that I get\nI’ll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret\nLet’s take our time to say what we want (say what we want)\nUse what we got before it’s all gone (all gone)\n’Cause no (no), we’re not promised tomorrow\nSo I’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you (lose you)\nI’m gonna hold you (hey) like I’m saying goodbye\nWherever we’re standing (yeah), I won’t take you for granted\n’Cause we’ll never know when, when we’ll run out of time\nSo I’m

the sand\nSome would say that I’m all alone\nBut I am, I’m nothing without love\nI wanna hold her in my arms\nBut she feeling low, she feeling sad\nI would take credit for what’s wrong\nBut I am, I’m nothing without love\nThree years at sea after the storm\nIn this sinking ship that love had put me on\nGod, I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home\nBut I, I got nowhere to go\nNow here you show up with the force of a wave\nAnd so I’m setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state, hey-hey\nI don’t wanna lose this one, she made me feel whole\nYou know I am, I’m nothing without love\nOh, baby, show me a sign\nSend up a signal that everything’s fine\nCome on slide up right here by my side\nYou know that I, I wanna rest in your life\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey,

hey\nI am nothing without love\nI’m just these thoughts without a pen\nAnd I would take credit for this song\nBut I am nothing without love\nBaby, show me a sign\nSend up a signal that everything’s fine\nOh, just come on, come one, come on, come on right by my side\nDon’t you know that I, don’t you know that I, I wanna rest in your life\nI wanna rest in your life\nI wanna rest in your life\n’Cause I am, I’m nothing without love\n\n\nPerhpas Love\nPerhaps love is like a resting place\nA shelter from the storm\nIt exists to give you comfort\nIt is there to keep you warm\nAnd in those times of trouble\nWhen you are most alone\nThe memory of love will bring you home\nPerhaps love is like a window\nPerhaps an open door\nIt invites you to come closer\nIt wants to show you more\nAnd even if you lose yourself\nAnd don’t know what to do\nThe memory of love will see you through\nOh, love to some is like a cloud\nTo some as strong as steel\nFor some a way of living\nFor some a way to feel\nAnd some say love is holding on\nAnd some say letting go\nAnd some say love is everything\nAnd some say they don’t know\nPerhaps love is like the ocean\nFull of conflict, full of change\nLike a fire when it’s cold outside\nOr thunder when it rains\nIf I should live forever\nAnd all my dreams come true\nMy memories of love will be of you\n\n\nSailing\n[Verse 1]\nWell, it’s not far down to paradise\nAt least it’s not for me\nAnd if the wind is right, you can sail away\nAnd find tranquility\nOh, the canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me\n[Verse 2]\nIt’s not far to never never land\nNo reason to pretend\nAnd if the wind is right, you can find the joy\nOf innocence again\nOh, the canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me\n[Chorus]\nSailing\nTakes me away to where I’ve always heard it could be\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\nSoon, I will be free\n[Verse 3]\nFantasy\nIt gets the best of me\nWhen I’m sailing\nAll caught up in the reverie\nEvery word is a symphony\nWon’t you believe me?\n\n\nSomeone Like You\nI heard that you’re settled down\nThat you found a girl and you’re married now\nI heard that your dreams came true\nGuess she gave you things, I didn’t give to you\nOld friend, why are you so shy?\nAin’t like you to hold back or hide from the light\nI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\nBut I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it\nI had hoped you’d see my face\nAnd that you’d be reminded that for me, it isn’t over\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n“Don’t forget me,” I beg\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\nYou know how the time flies\nOnly yesterday was the time of our lives\nWe were born and raised in a summer haze\nBound by the surprise of our glory days\nI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\nBut I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it\nI had hoped you’d see my face\nAnd that you’d be reminded that for me, it isn’t over\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n“Don’t forget me,” I begged\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\nNothing compares, no worries or cares\nRegrets and mistakes, they’re memories made\nWho would have known how bittersweet this would taste?\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you\n“Don’t forget me,” I beg\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n“Don’t forget me,” I begged\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\n\n\nSeven Daffoldils\nI may not have a mansion\nI haven’t any land\nNot even a paper dollar\nTo crinkle in my hands\nBut I can show you morning on a thousand hills\nAnd kiss you and give you seven daffodils\nI do not have a fortune\nTo buy you pretty things\nBut I can weave you moonbeams\nFor necklaces and rings\nAnd I can show you morning on a thousand hills\nAnd kiss you and give you seven daffodils\nOn seven golden daffodils\nAll shining in the sun\nTo light our way to evening\nWhen our day is done\nAnd I will give you music and a crust of bread\nA pillow of piny boughs to rest your head\nA pillow of piny boughs to rest your\n\n\nSee You Again\n[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]\nOkay,

Cupid hit me with precision, I\nWonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind (Yeah)\nI said, I said\nI’m sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing\nYou’re the one that’s always running through my daydream, I\nI can only see your face when I close my eyes\n(Uh-huh)\n[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]\nCan I get a kiss? (Ah)\nAnd can you make it last forever? (I said)\nI said I’m ’bout to go to war (Uh-huh)\nAnd I don’t know if I’ma see you again\nCan I get a kiss? (Can I?)\nAnd can you make it last forever?

    "section": "",
    "text": "This guideline shows how to automate access to a private dataset on ERDDAP that requires Google login using Chrome.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall Required Python Libraries\n\nRun the following command to install the necessary libraries:\n{bash}\n\npip install requests selenium webdriver_manager\n\n\nSetup WebDriver and Helper Functions\n\nSelenium is a tool that allows automated control of web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Here, we use it to navigate to the ERDDAP login page, handle Google login , and retrieve the authentication cookies.\nwebdriver_manager helps to automatically download and set up the appropriate WebDriver for Chrome.\n\n\nHelper Functions\nTo access the ERDDAP dataset, we define three helper functions:\nget_browser_cookies(login_url): Opens Chrome to log into the ERDDAP server and retrieves the login cookies. authenticate_session(login_url): Uses the cookies from get_browser_cookies to create an authenticated session. download_data(session, data_url, outfile): Uses the authenticated session to access the dataset URL and save it to the specified output file.\n\n\nCode\nHere is the code with comments for each part:\n{python}\n\nimport requests  # For managing sessions and HTTP requests\nfrom selenium import webdriver  # For browser control\nfrom webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager  # To manage the browser driver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\nimport time\n\n\ndef get_browser_cookies(url):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve cookies from the browser using Selenium.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Set Chrome options to suppress automation messages\n    chrome_options = Options()\n    chrome_options.add_argument(\"--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled\")  # Disable automation message\n    chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"excludeSwitches\", [\"enable-automation\"])  # Hide \"Chrome is controlled\" message\n    chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"useAutomationExtension\", False)  # Disable the default automation extension\n\n    # Start the Chrome browser using webdriver-manager\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=chrome_options)\n\n    try:\n        # Navigate to the login page\n        driver.get(url)\n        \n        # Wait for the user to complete login (adjust time as needed)\n        time.sleep(60)  \n\n        # Retrieve cookies from the browser session\n        cookies = driver.get_cookies()\n        \n        # Verify cookies were retrieved successfully\n        if not cookies:\n            raise ValueError(\n                \"No cookies retrieved. Possible causes:\\n\"\n                \"- Insufficient sleep time; try increasing the sleep duration.\\n\"\n                \"- Incompatible or missing WebDriver for Chrome.\"\n            )\n\n        # Format cookies for session headers\n        formatted_cookies = \"; \".join([f\"{cookie['name']}={cookie['value']}\" for cookie in cookies])\n        print(\"Cookies Retrieved. Attempting to Access ERDDAP Dataset..\")\n        \n    finally:\n        # Close the browser\n        driver.quit()\n    \n    return formatted_cookies\n\ndef download_data(session, file_url, output_filename):\n    \"\"\"Download data file using the authenticated session.\"\"\"\n    response = session.get(file_url)\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        print(\"Successfully downloaded data.\")\n\n        # Write the file content to disk\n        with open(output_filename, 'wb') as f:\n            f.write(response.content)\n        print(f\"Data saved to {output_filename}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download data. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n        print(\"Response:\", response.text)\n\ndef authenticate_session(url):\n    \"\"\"Authenticate session and return the session object.\"\"\"\n    session = requests.Session()\n\n    # Get cookies from ERDDAP login page using Selenium\n    try:\n        cookie_header = get_browser_cookies(url)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n        exit(1)\n\n    # Set headers with cookies for authenticated requests\n    session.headers.update({\n        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0',\n        'Cookie': cookie_header\n    })\n    return session\n\n# Main Execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    # ERDDAP login URL (through Google login)\n    login_url = \"https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/loginGoogle.html\"\n    \n    # ERDDAP data URL (direct link to dataset in .nc format)\n    data_url = [YOUR_ERDDAP_DATASET_URL]\n    \n    # Step 1: Authenticate Session\n    session = authenticate_session(login_url)\n\n    # Step 2: Download the data file and save as YOUR FILENAME\n    download_data(session, data_url, [FILENAME])\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Usage\n\nInstall Required Libraries: Make sure requests, selenium, and webdriver_manager are installed.\nSet Login URL and Data URL:\n\nThe login_url is the ERDDAP login page (usually loginGoogle.html for Google login).\nThe data_url points to the specific dataset you want to download.\n\nRun the Script:\n\nRun the script to open Chrome, log in to ERDDAP, retrieve cookies, and download the specified dataset.\nAdjust time.sleep(60) in get_browser_cookies to allow enough time for login if needed.\n\n\n\n\nUsage Notes\n\nBrowser and Driver Compatibility: Ensure that ChromeDriver is compatible with your installed Chrome version. webdriver_manager handles this automatically, but Chrome must be installed.\nAlternative Browsers: This guide uses Chrome for simplicity, but Firefox and Edge are also supported with minor adjustments to the code.\nError Handling: The script checks if cookies were successfully retrieved. If not, it suggests potential issues."
