somehow\nOne step closer\nI have died every day waiting for you\nDarling, don’t be afraid\nI have loved you for a thousand years\nI’ll love you for a thousand more\nTime stands still\nBeauty in all she is\nI will be brave\nI will not let anything take away\nWhat’s standing in front of me\nEvery breath, every hour has come to this\nOne step closer\nI have died every day waiting for you\nDarling, don’t be afraid\nI have loved you for a thousand years\nI’ll love you for a thousand more\nAnd all along I believed I would find you\nTime has brought your heart to me\nI have loved you for a thousand years\nI’ll love you for a thousand more\nOne step closer\nOne step closer\nI have died every day waiting for you\nDarling, don’t be afraid\nI have loved you for a thousand years\nI’ll love you for a thousand more\nAnd all along I believed I would find you\nTime has brought your heart to me\nI have loved you for a thousand years\nI’ll love you for a thousand more\n\n\nAlways remember us this way\nThat Arizona sky burnin’ in your eyes\nYou look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire\nIt’s buried in my soul like California gold\nYou found the light in me that I couldn’t find\nSo when I’m all choked up\nAnd I can’t find the words\nEvery time we say goodbye\nBaby, it hurts\nWhen the sun goes down\nAnd the band won’t play\nI’ll always remember us this way\nLovers in the night\nPoets tryin’ to write\nWe don’t know how to rhyme\nBut, damn, we try\nBut all I really know\nYou’re where I wanna go\nThe part of me that’s you will never die\nSo when I’m all choked up\nAnd I can’t find

are torn by courage born of a love that’s free\nA time when dreams so long denied\nCan flourish as we unveil the love we now must hide\nA time for us at last to see\nA life worthwhile for you and me\nAnd with our love through tears and thorns\nWe will endure as we pass surely through every storm\nA time for us some day there’ll be a new world\nA world of shining hope for you and me\nFor you and me\nAnd with our love through tears and thorns\nWe will endure as we pass surely through every storm\nA time for us some day there’ll be a new world\nA world of shining hope for you and me\nA world of shining hope for you and me\n\n\nYou Raise Me Up\n[Verse]\nWhen I am down, and, oh, my soul so weary\nWhen troubles come and my heart burdened be\nThen I am still and wait here in the silence\nUntil You come and sit awhile with me\n[Chorus]\nYou raise me up so I can stand on mountains\nYou raise me up to walk on stormy seas\nI am strong when I am on your shoulders\nYou raise me up to more than I can be\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus] You raise me up so I can stand on mountains\nYou raise me up to walk on stormy seas\nI am strong when I am on your shoulders\nYou raise me up to more than I can be\nYou raise me up (Up) so I can stand on mountains (Stand on mountains)\nYou raise me up to walk on stormy seas (Stormy seas)\nI am strong (I am strong) when I am on your shoulders (Ooh-ooh)\nYou raise me up to more than I can be\nYou raise me up (Up) so I can stand on mountains (Stand on mountains)\nYou raise me up to walk on stormy seas (Stormy seas)\nI am strong when I am on your shoulders\nYou raise me up to more than I can be\n[Outro]\nYou raise me up to more than I can be\n\n\nShe\n[Verse 1]\nShe may be the face I can’t forget\nA trace of pleasure or regret\nMay be my treasure or the price I have to pay\nShe may be the song that summer sings\nMay be the chill that autumn brings\nMay be a hundred different things\nWithin the measure of a day\n[Verse 2]\nShe may be the beauty or the beast\nMay be the famine or the feast\nMay turn each day into a heaven or a hell\nShe may be the mirror of my dreams\nA smile reflected in a stream\nShe may not be what she may seem\nInside her shell\n[Verse 3]\nShe, who always seems so happy in a crowd\nWhose eyes can be so private and so proud\nNo one’s allowed to see them when they cry\nShe may be the love that cannot hope to last\nMay come to me from shadows of the past\nThat I’ll remember till the day I die\n[Verse 4]\nShe may be the reason I survive\nThe why and wherefore I’m alive\nThe one I’ll care for through the rough and ready years\nMe, I’ll take her laughter and her tears\nAnd make them all my souvenirs\nFor where she goes, I’ve got to be\nThe meaning of my life is she\nShe\nOh, she\n\n\nIf\n[Verse 1]\nIf a picture paints a thousand words\nThen why can’t I paint you?\nThe words will never show\nThe you I’ve come to know\n[Verse 2]\nIf a face could launch a thousand ships\nThen where am I to go?\nThere’s no one home but you\nYou’re all that’s left me too\n[Chorus]\nAnd when my love for life is running dry\nYou come and pour yourself on me\n[Verse 3]\nIf a man could be two places at one time\nI’d be with you\nTomorrow and today\nBeside you all the way\n[Verse 4]\nIf the world should stop revolving\nSpinning slowly down to die\nI’d spend the end with you\nAnd when the world was through\n[Chorus]\nThen one by one the stars would all go out\nThen you and I would simply fly away\n\n\nWhite Christmas\nI’m dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know (Ooh)\nWhere the treetops glisten and children listen\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow\nI’m dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write (Ooh)\nMay your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\nI’m dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know (Ooh)\nWhere the treetops glisten and children listen\nTo hear (To hear the sleigh bеlls in the snow)\nI’m dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith еvery Christmas card I write (Mm)\nMay your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white (Mm) Mm-mm-mm (Mm)\n\n\nShape of my heart\nHe deals the cards as a meditation\nAnd those he plays never suspect\nHe doesn’t play for the money he wins\nHe don’t play for respect\nHe deals the cards to find the answer\nThe sacred geometry of chance\nThe hidden law of a probable outcome\nThe numbers lead a dance\nI know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\nI know that the clubs are weapons of war\nI know that diamonds mean money for this art\nBut that’s not the shape of my heart\nHe may play the jack of diamonds\nHe may lay the queen of spades\nHe may conceal a king in his hand\nWhile the memory of it fades\nI know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\nI know that the clubs are weapons of war\nI know that diamonds mean money for this art\nBut that’s not the shape of my heart\nThat’s not the shape\nThe shape of my heart\nIf I told her that I loved you\nYou’d maybe think there’s something wrong\nI’m not a man of too many faces\nThe mask I wear is one\nBut those who speak know nothing\nAnd find out to their cost\nLike those who curse their luck in too many places\nAnd those who fear are lost\nI know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\nI know that the clubs are weapons of war\nI know that diamonds mean money for this art\nBut that’s not the shape of my heart\nThat’s not the shape of my heart\nThat’s not the shape\nThe shape of my heart\n\n\nAll I Want For Christmas Is You\n[Intro]\nI don’t want a lot for Christmas\nThere is just one thing I need\nI don’t care about the presents\nUnderneath the Christmas tree\nI just want you for my own\nMore than you could ever know\nMake my wish come true\nAll I want for Christmas is you, yeah\n[Verse 1]\nI don’t want a lot for Christmas\nThere is just one thing I need (And I)\nDon’t care about the presents\nUnderneath the Christmas tree\nI don’t need to hang my stocking\nThere upon the fireplace (Ah)\nSanta Claus won’t make me happy\nWith a toy on Christmas Day\n[Chorus]\nI just want you for my own (Ooh)\nMore than you could ever know (Ooh)\nMake my wish come true\nAll I want for Christmas is you\nYou, baby\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I won’t ask for much this Christmas\nI won’t even wish for snow (And I)\nI’m just gonna keep on waiting\nUnderneath the mistletoe\nI won’t make a list and send it\nTo the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)\nI won’t even stay awake to\nHear those magic reindeer click\n[Chorus]\n’Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)\nHolding on to me so tight (Ooh)\nWhat more can I do?\nOh baby, all I want for Christmas is you\nYou, baby\n[Bridge] Oh, all the lights are shining\nSo brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)\nAnd the sound of children’s\nLaughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)\nAnd everyone is singing (Oh yeah)\nI hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)\nSanta, won’t you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)\nWon’t you please bring my baby to me?\n\n\nDon’t Forget to Remember\nOh my heart won’t believe that you have left me\nI keep telling my self that it’s true\nI can get over anything you want my love\nBut I can’t get myself over you\nDon’t forget to remember me\nAnd the love that used to be I still remember youI love you\nIn my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above\nDon’t forget to remember me my love\nOn my wall lies a photograph of you girl\nThough I try to forget you somehow\nYou’re the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole\nLet me try to go on living right now\nDon’t forget to remember me\nAnd the love that used to be\nI still remember you\nI love you\nIn my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above\nDon’t forget to remember me my love\n\n\nRight Here Waiting\nOceans apart, day after day\nAnd I slowly go insane\nI hear your voice on the line\nBut it doesn’t stop the pain\nIf I see you next to never\nThen how can we say forever?\nWherever you go\nWhatever you do\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWhatever it takes\nOr how my heart breaks\nI will be right here waiting for you\nI took for granted, all the times\nThat I thought would last somehow\nI hear the laughter, I taste the tears\nBut I can’t get near you now\nOh, can’t you see it, baby?\nYou’ve got me going crazy\nWherever you go\nWhatever you do\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWhatever it takes\nOr how my heart breaks\nI will be right here waiting for you\nI wonder how we can survive\nThis romance\nBut in the end if I’m with you\nI’ll take the chance\nOh, can’t you see it, baby?\nYou’ve got me going crazy\nWherever you go\nWhatever you do\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWhatever it takes\nOr how my heart breaks\nI will be right here waiting for you\nWaiting for you\n\n\nSorry you are only lonely\n[Verse 1]\nWhen the world is ready to fall\nOn your little shoulders\nAnd when you’re feeling lonely and small\nYou need somebody there to hold you\n[Chorus]\nYou can call out my name\nWhen you’re only lonely\nNow don’t you ever be ashamed\nYou’re only lonely\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you need somebody around\nOn the nights that try you\nRemember, I was there when you were a queen\nAnd I’ll be the last one there beside you\n[Chorus]\nSo you can call out my name\nWhen you’re only lonely\nNow don’t you ever be ashamed\nYou’re only lonely\n[Post-Chorus]\n(You’re only lonely)\n(You’re only lonely)\n(You’re only lonely)\n(Ooh)\n\n\nLike I am gonna lose you\nI found myself dreaming in silver and gold\nLike a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows\nWe were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close\nSplit second and you disappeared and then I was all alone\nI woke up in tears with you by my side\nA breath of relief, and I realized\nNo, we’re not promised tomorrow\nSo I’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you\nI’m gonna hold you like I’m saying goodbye\nWherever we’re standing, I won’t take you for granted\n’Cause we’ll never know when, when we’ll run out of time\nSo I’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you (lose you)\nI’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you\nIn the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke\nYou could lose everything, the truth is you never know\nSo I’ll kiss you longer, baby (hey), any chance that I get\nI’ll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret\nLet’s take our time to say what we want (say what we want)\nUse what we got before it’s all gone (all gone)\n’Cause no (no), we’re not promised tomorrow\nSo I’m gonna love you like I’m gonna lose you (lose you)\nI’m gonna hold you (hey) like I’m saying goodbye\nWherever we’re standing (yeah), I won’t take you for granted\n’Cause we’ll never know when, when we’ll run out of time\nSo I’m gonna love you (I’m gonna love you)\nLike I’m gonna lose you (like I’m gonna lose you)\nI’m gonna love you (love) like I’m gonna lose you\nI’m gonna love you (oh)\nLike I’m gonna lose you (like I’m gonna lose you)\nI’m gonna hold you like I’m saying goodbye\nWherever we’re standing, I won’t take you for granted\n’Cause we’ll never know when, when we’ll run out of time\nSo I’m gonna love you (I’m gonna love you, baby)\nLike I’m gonna lose you (like I’m gonna lose you)\nI’m gonna love you (oh) like I’m gonna lose you\n\n\nNothing without Love\nI am nothing without love\nI’m but a ship stuck in the sand\nSome would say that I’m all alone\nBut I am, I’m nothing without love\nI wanna hold her in my arms\nBut she feeling low, she feeling sad\nI would take credit for what’s wrong\nBut I am, I’m nothing without love\nThree years at sea after the storm\nIn this sinking ship that love had put me on\nGod, I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home\nBut I, I got nowhere to go\nNow here you show up with the force of a wave\nAnd so I’m setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state, hey-hey\nI don’t wanna lose this one, she made me feel whole\nYou know I am, I’m nothing without love\nOh, baby, show me a sign\nSend up a signal that everything’s fine\nCome on slide up right here by my side\nYou know that I, I wanna rest in your life\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh (I wanna rest in your life)\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey, na-na-na, oh\nNa-na-na, hey\nI am nothing without love\nI’m just these thoughts without a pen\nAnd I would take credit for this song\nBut I am nothing without love\nBaby, show me a sign\nSend up a signal that everything’s fine\nOh, just come on, come one, come on, come on right by my side\nDon’t you know that I, don’t you know that I, I wanna rest in your life\nI wanna rest in your life\nI wanna rest in your life\n’Cause I am, I’m nothing without love\n\n\nPerhpas Love\nPerhaps love is like a resting place\nA shelter from the storm\nIt exists to give you comfort\nIt is there to keep you warm\nAnd in those times of trouble\nWhen you are most alone\nThe memory of love will bring you home\nPerhaps love is like a window\nPerhaps an open door\nIt invites you to come closer\nIt wants to show you more\nAnd even if you lose yourself\nAnd don’t know what to do\nThe memory of love will see you through\nOh, love to some is like a cloud\nTo some as strong as steel\nFor some a way of living\nFor some a way to feel\nAnd some say love is holding on\nAnd some say letting go\nAnd some say love is everything\nAnd some say they don’t know\nPerhaps love is like the ocean\nFull of conflict, full of change\nLike a fire when it’s cold outside\nOr thunder when it rains\nIf I should live forever\nAnd all my dreams come true\nMy memories of love will be of you\n\n\nSailing\n[Verse 1]\nWell, it’s not far down to paradise\nAt least it’s not for me\nAnd if the wind is right, you can sail away\nAnd find tranquility\nOh, the canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me\n[Verse 2]\nIt’s not far to never never land\nNo reason to pretend\nAnd if the wind is right, you can find the joy\nOf innocence again\nOh, the canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me\n[Chorus]\nSailing\nTakes me away to where I’ve always heard it could be\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\nSoon, I will be free\n[Verse 3]\nFantasy\nIt gets the best of me\nWhen I’m sailing\nAll caught up in the reverie\nEvery word is a symphony\nWon’t you believe me?\n\n\nSomeone Like You\nI heard that you’re settled down\nThat you found a girl and you’re married now\nI heard that your dreams came true\nGuess she gave you things, I didn’t give to you\nOld friend, why are you so shy?\nAin’t like you to hold back or hide from the light\nI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\nBut I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it\nI had hoped you’d see my face\nAnd that you’d be reminded that for me, it isn’t over\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n“Don’t forget me,” I beg\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\nYou know how the time flies\nOnly yesterday was the time of our lives\nWe were born and raised in a summer haze\nBound by the surprise of our glory days\nI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\nBut I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it\nI had hoped you’d see my face\nAnd that you’d be reminded that for me, it isn’t over\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n“Don’t forget me,” I begged\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\nNothing compares, no worries or cares\nRegrets and mistakes, they’re memories made\nWho would have known how bittersweet this would taste?\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you\n“Don’t forget me,” I beg\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\nNever mind, I’ll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n“Don’t forget me,” I begged\nI remember you said\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\n“Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead”\n\n\nSeven Daffoldils\nI may not have a mansion\nI haven’t any land\nNot even a paper dollar\nTo crinkle in my hands\nBut I can show you morning on a thousand hills\nAnd kiss you and give you seven daffodils\nI do not have a fortune\nTo buy you pretty things\nBut I can weave you moonbeams\nFor necklaces and rings\nAnd I can show you morning on a thousand hills\nAnd kiss you and give you seven daffodils\nOn seven golden daffodils\nAll shining in the sun\nTo light our way to evening\nWhen our day is done\nAnd I will give you music and a crust of bread\nA pillow of piny boughs to rest your head\nA pillow of piny boughs to rest your\n\n\nSee You Again\n[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]\nOkay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—\n[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]\nYou live in my dream state\nRelocate my fantasy\nI stay in reality\nYou live in my dream state\nAny time I count sheep\nThat’s the only time we make up, make up\nYou exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids\nNow, I don’t wanna wake up\n[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]\n20/20, 20/20 visions\nCupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I\nWonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind (Yeah)\nI said, I said\nI’m sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing\nYou’re the one that’s always running through my daydream, I\nI can only see your face when I close my eyes\n(Uh-huh)\n[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]\nCan I get a kiss? (Ah)\nAnd can you make it last forever? (I said)\nI said I’m ’bout to go to war (Uh-huh)\nAnd I don’t know if I’ma see you again\nCan I get a kiss? (Can I?)\nAnd can you make it last forever? (Can you?)\nI said I’m ’bout to go to war (’Bout to)\nAnd I don’t know if I’ma see you again\nAyy, switch it up\n\n\nFeelings\n[Verse 1]\nFeelings, nothing more than feelings\nTrying to forget my feelings of love\nTeardrops rolling down on my face\nTrying to forget my feelings of love\n[Chorus]\nFeelings, for all my life I’ll feel it\nI wish I’ve never met you, girl\nYou’ll never come again\nFeelings, whoa, oh, oh, feelings\nWhoa, oh, oh, feel it again in my arms\n[Verse 2]\nFeelings, feelings like I’ve never lost you\nAnd feelings like I’ve never have you again in my heart\n[Chorus]\nFeelings, for all my life I’ll feel it\nI wish I’ve never met you, girl\nYou’ll never come again\n[Verse 2]\nFeelings, feelings like I’ve never lost you\nAnd feelings like I’ve never have you again in my life\n\n\nAlways Remember Us This Way\nThat Arizona sky burnin’ in your eyes\nYou look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire\nIt’s buried in my soul like California gold\nYou found the light in me that I couldn’t find\nSo when I’m all choked up\nAnd I can’t find the words\nEvery time we say goodbye\nBaby, it hurts\nWhen the sun goes down\nAnd the band won’t play\nI’ll always remember us this way\nLovers in the night\nPoets tryin’ to write\nWe don’t know how to rhyme\nBut, damn, we try\nBut all I really know\nYou’re where I wanna go\nThe part of me that’s you will never die\nSo when I’m all choked up\nAnd I can’t find the words\nEvery time we say goodbye\nBaby, it hurts\nWhen the sun goes down\nAnd the band won’t play\nI’ll always remember us this way\nOh, yeah\nI don’t wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nSo when I’m all choked up\nAnd I can’t find the words\nEvery time we say goodbye\nBaby, it hurts\nWhen the sun goes down\nAnd the band won’t play\nI’ll always remember us this way, way, yeah\nWhen you look at me\nAnd the whole world fades\nI’ll always remember us this way\n\n\nGolden\nI was a ghost, I was alone (hah)\n어두워진 앞길 속에 (hah)\nGiven the throne, I didn’t know how to believe\nI was the queen that I’m meant to be\nI lived two lives, tried to play both sides\nBut I couldn’t find my own place\nCalled a problem child ’cause I got too wild\nBut now that’s how I’m getting paid 끝없이 on stage\nI’m done hidin’, now I’m shinin’ like I’m born to be\nWe dreamin’ hard, we came so far, now I’ll believe\nWe’re goin’ up, up, up, it’s our moment\nYou know together we’re glowing\nGonna be, gonna be golden\nOh, up, up, up with our voices\n영원히 깨질 수 없는\nGonna be, gonna be golden\nOh, I’m done hidin’, now I’m shinin’ like I’m born to be\nOh, our time, no fears, no lies\nThat’s who we’re born to be\nWaited so long to break these walls down\nTo wake up and feel like me\nPut these patterns all in the past now\nAnd finally live like the girl they all see\nNo more hiding, I’ll be shining like I’m born to be\n’Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I’ll believe\nWe’re goin’ up, up, up, it’s our moment\nYou know together we’re glowing\nGonna be, gonna be golden\nOh, up, up, up, with our voices\n영원히 깨질 수 없는\nGonna be, gonna be golden\nOh, I’m done hidin’, now I’m shining like I’m born to be\nOh, our time, no fears, no lies\nThat’s who we’re born to be\nYou know we’re gonna be, gonna be golden\nWe’re gonna be, gonna be\nBorn to be, born to be glowin’\n밝게 빛나는 우린\nYou know that it’s our time, no fears, no lies\nThat’s who we’re born to be\n\n\nLove Story\nWhere do I begin\nTo tell the story of how great a love can be\nThe sweet love story that is older than the sea\nThe simple truth about the love she brings to me\nWhere do I start\nWith her first hello\nShe gave new meaning to this empty world of mine\nThere’d never be another love, another time\nShe came into my life and made the living fine\nShe fills my heart\nShe fills my heart with very special things\nWith angels’ songs, with wild imaginings\nShe fills my soul with so much love\nThat anywhere I go I’m never lonely\nWith her around, who could be lonely\nI reach for her hand, it’s always there\nHow long does it last\nCan love be measured by the hours in a day\nI have no answers now but this much I can say\nI know I’ll need her ’til the stars all burn away\nAnd she’ll be there\nHow long does it last\nCan love be measured by the hours in a day\nI have no answers now but this much I can say\nI know I’ll need her ’til the stars all burn away\nAnd she’ll be there\n\n\nSay You Say Me\nSay you, say me\nSay it for always\nThat’s the way it should be\nSay you, say me\nSay it together, naturally\nI had a dream, I had an awesome dream\nPeople in the park playing games in the dark\nAnd what they played was a masquerade\nAnd from behind the walls of doubt\nA voice was crying out\nSay you, say me\nSay it for always\nThat’s the way it should be\nSay you, say me\nSay it together, naturally\nAs we go down life’s lonesome highway\nSeems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two\nThat helping hand\nSomeone who understands\nThat when you feel you’ve lost your way\nYou’ve got someone there to say, “I’ll show you”\nSay you, say me\nSay it for always (oh)\nThat’s the way it should be\nSay you, say me\nSay it together, naturally\nSo you think you know the answers? Oh no\nWell the whole world’s got you dancing\nThat’s right, I’m telling you\nTime to start believing, oh yes\nBelieve in who you are\nYou are a shining star\nSay you, say me\nSay it for always\nOh, that’s the way it should be\nSay you, say me\nSay it together, naturally\nSay it together, naturally\n\n\nAll of Me\nWhat would I do without your smart mouth?\nDrawing me in, and you kicking me out\nYou’ve got my head spinning, no kidding, I can’t pin you down\nWhat’s going on in that beautiful mind?\nI’m on your magical mystery ride\nAnd I’m so dizzy, don’t know what hit me, but I’ll be alright\nMy head’s under water\nBut I’m breathing fine\nYou’re crazy and I’m out of my mind\n’Cause all of me\nLoves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me\nI’ll give my all to you\nYou’re my end and my beginning\nEven when I lose, I’m winning\n’Cause I give you all of me\nAnd you give me all of you, oh-oh\nHow many times do I have to tell you?\nEven when you’re crying, you’re beautiful too\nThe world is beating you down, I’m around through every mood\nYou’re my downfall, you’re my muse\nMy worst distraction, my rhythm and blues\nI can’t stop singing, it’s ringing in my head for you\nMy head’s under water\nBut I’m breathing fine\nYou’re crazy and I’m out of my mind\n’Cause all of me\nLoves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me\nI’ll give my all to you\nYou’re my end and my beginning\nEven when I lose, I’m winning\n’Cause I give you all of me\nAnd you give me all of you, oh-oh\nGive me all of you, oh\nCards on the table, we’re both showing hearts\nRisking it all, though it’s hard\n’Cause all of me\nLoves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me\nI’ll give my all to you\nYou’re my end and my beginning\nEven when I lose, I’m winning\n’Cause I give you all of me\nAnd you give

Here, we use Seleminum to launch the ERDDAP login page, handle Google login, and retrieve the session cookies.\nwebdriver_manager helps to automatically download and set up the appropriate WebDriver (in this case Chrome).\n\n\nHelper Functions\nTo access the ERDDAP dataset, we define three helper functions:\n\nget_browser_cookies(login_url): Opens Chrome to log into the ERDDAP server and retrieves the session cookies.\nauthenticate_session(login_url): Uses the cookies from get_browser_cookies to create an authenticated session.\ndownload_data(session, data_url, outfile): Uses the authenticated session to access the dataset URL and save it to the specified output file.\n\n\n\nCode\nHere is the code with comments for each part:\n{python}\n\nimport requests  # For managing sessions and HTTP requests\nfrom selenium import webdriver  # For browser control\nfrom webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager  # To manage the browser driver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\nimport time\n\n\ndef get_browser_cookies(url):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve cookies from the browser using Selenium.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Set Chrome options to suppress automation messages\n    chrome_options = Options()\n    chrome_options.add_argument(\"--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled\")  # Disable automation message\n    chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"excludeSwitches\", [\"enable-automation\"])  # Hide \"Chrome is controlled\" message\n    chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"useAutomationExtension\", False)  # Disable the default automation extension\n\n    # Start the Chrome browser using webdriver-manager\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=chrome_options)\n\n    try:\n        # Navigate to the login page\n        driver.get(url)\n        \n        # Wait for the user to complete login (adjust time as needed)\n        time.sleep(60)  \n\n        # Retrieve cookies from the browser session\n        cookies = driver.get_cookies()\n        \n        # Verify cookies were retrieved successfully\n        if not cookies:\n            raise ValueError(\n                \"No cookies retrieved.

If not, it suggests potential issues."

Interestingly, what I enjoyed most were the keynote speakers and the spontaneous conversations during breaks.\nThe keynote speakers were inspirational, offering a big-picture perspective and motivations for pursuing a meaningful career. The impromptu discussions with conference attendees—who came from diverse backgrounds gave me valuable insights, not just in data science, but in life.\nHaving had this wonderful opportunity to attend, I’d like to share a few key takeways. This blog isn’t about the specific topics covered in the conference session, but rather about what I took away from the overall experience."

It’s important to agree on a set of core values, such as radical transparency, trust, respect, courage, and commitment.\nChatGPT is becoming widely used, especially among the new generation of professionals. Traditional software engineering interviews often involve requesting code samples, but this practice is becoming less relevant as many candidates now use ChatGPT. What does the future hold? Perhaps it lies with those who can construct the “right” questions to solve difficult problems."

    "title": "Lit Review: Comparing resampling methods",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Article: Validation of machine learning ridge regression models using Monte Carlo, bootstrap, and variations in cross-validation Link to the article\nThe article compares performance of the commonly used resampling techniques in machine/statistical learning using ridge regression models. There are many conflicting suggestions for methods and parameter values for fine tuning hyper parameters.\nUsing simulations, the author tries to answer the following questions:\n\nWhich of the four resampling methods is most effective in selecting a suitable regulatiziation paremter \\(\\lambda\\)?\nDoes increasing the number of repetitions - from 10 to 50 - improve the performance of the resampling method?\nKeeping the number of repetitions constant, which approach, single-run cross-validation or repated cross-validation, performs better?\nFor k=fold CV, what is an appropriate fold size k?\nWhich randomization approach is more effective, Monte Carlo (sampling without replacement) or bootstrap (with replacement)?\n\n\nRidge regression model\nIn regression model where Y is the target (response) variable and X_1, X_2, ..XP are feature (independent) variables, our goal is to find _beta coefficients that minimize the SSE in OLS. Linear model could have an overfitting problem.\nTo deal with overfitting issue in linear models, the ridge regression model was used to apply regularization. The penality term was added to the SSE equation.\n\\[\n\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} ({\\beta}_j^2)\n\\]\nThe ridge regression model and MSE are used to find the lambda estimate. Data set is split into a training and validation sets where training set is used for parameter estimation and the validation set for evaluating overfit. One split of a dataset could create bias in MSE thus resampling methods are used to obtain MSE estimates.\nRegularization results in shiriking the \\(\\beta_j\\) toward 0 as \\(\\lambda\\) becomes large (or \\(\\beta\\) is same when \\(\\lambda\\) =0).\n\n\nResampling methods\n\nMonte Carlo\n(Other names: repeated learning-testing, repeated holdout, random subsampling)\nMonte Carlo sampling randomly shuffles the dataset (randomizing rows) and select the first 75% to be a training set and the remaining 25% as a validation set. This is sampling without replacement.\nThe validation error is averaged over n repetitions.\n\n\nBootstrap\nSimilar to Monte Carlo sampling where data are randomly selected from the dataset but with replacement.\nThe validation error is averaged over n repetitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSunnys note\n\n\n\ncommonly (or by default) equal sampling probability?\n\n\n\n\nk-fold CV (Cross-validation)\nA dataset is divided into k partition at random (most commonly k=5 or 10). One partition is held out (set aside) as a validation set, and the remaining k-1 partitions of data are used as a training set. __The validation error_ is averaged over k repetitions.\nMost extreme case of k-fold CV, known as LOOCV (Leave One Out CV) is k = n where 1 observation is held out at each iteration.\n\n\nrepeated k-fold CV\nk-fold CV is done over n repetition and obtain \\({n} x {k}\\) validation errors.\nThe validation error is averaged over \\({n} \\times {k}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nmost commonly use k=fold CV only once (rep =1) and repeated method is suggested as a way of obtaining more accurate and reliable estimates of error rates"

Datum describes how coordiate system is alligned with the Earth.\nThere are two main types of Datum\n\nGeodetic (or geographic) datum : defines origin and orientation of latitude and longitude.\nVertical datum : defines elevation or depth (sea level)\n\nDatum includes 2 things: A Spheroid and Reference Point\nLocations CRS changes depending on which datum and spheroid are used to describe locations."

    "text": "This guideline shows how to automate access to a private dataset on ERDDAP that requires Google login using Chrome.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall Required Python Libraries\n\nRun the following command to install the necessary libraries:\n{bash}\n\npip install requests selenium webdriver_manager\n\n\nSetup WebDriver and Helper Functions\n\nSelenium is a tool that allows automated control of web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Here, we use it to navigate to the ERDDAP login page, handle Google login , and retrieve the authentication cookies.\nwebdriver_manager helps to automatically download and set up the appropriate WebDriver for Chrome.\n\n\nHelper Functions\nTo access the ERDDAP dataset, we define three helper functions:\nget_browser_cookies(login_url): Opens Chrome to log into the ERDDAP server and retrieves the login cookies. authenticate_session(login_url): Uses the cookies from get_browser_cookies to create an authenticated session. download_data(session, data_url, outfile): Uses the authenticated session to access the dataset URL and save it to the specified output file.\n\n\nCode\nHere is the code with comments for each part:\n{python}\n\nimport requests  # For managing sessions and HTTP requests\nfrom selenium import webdriver  # For browser control\nfrom webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager  # To manage the browser driver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\nimport time\n\n\ndef get_browser_cookies(url):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve cookies from the browser using Selenium.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Set Chrome options to suppress automation messages\n    chrome_options = Options()\n    chrome_options.add_argument(\"--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled\")  # Disable automation message\n    chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"excludeSwitches\", [\"enable-automation\"])  # Hide \"Chrome is controlled\" message\n    chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"useAutomationExtension\", False)  # Disable the default automation extension\n\n    # Start the Chrome browser using webdriver-manager\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=chrome_options)\n\n    try:\n        # Navigate to the login page\n        driver.get(url)\n        \n        # Wait for the user to complete login (adjust time as needed)\n        time.sleep(60)  \n\n        # Retrieve cookies from the browser session\n        cookies = driver.get_cookies()\n        \n        # Verify cookies were retrieved successfully\n        if not cookies:\n            raise ValueError(\n                \"No cookies retrieved. Possible causes:\\n\"\n                \"- Insufficient sleep time; try increasing the sleep duration.\\n\"\n                \"- Incompatible or missing WebDriver for Chrome.\"\n            )\n\n        # Format cookies for session headers\n        formatted_cookies = \"; \".join([f\"{cookie['name']}={cookie['value']}\" for cookie in cookies])\n        print(\"Cookies Retrieved. Attempting to Access ERDDAP Dataset..\")\n        \n    finally:\n        # Close the browser\n        driver.quit()\n    \n    return formatted_cookies\n\ndef download_data(session, file_url, output_filename):\n    \"\"\"Download data file using the authenticated session.\"\"\"\n    response = session.get(file_url)\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        print(\"Successfully downloaded data.\")\n\n        # Write the file content to disk\n        with open(output_filename, 'wb') as f:\n            f.write(response.content)\n        print(f\"Data saved to {output_filename}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download data. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n        print(\"Response:\", response.text)\n\ndef authenticate_session(url):\n    \"\"\"Authenticate session and return the session object.\"\"\"\n    session = requests.Session()\n\n    # Get cookies from ERDDAP login page using Selenium\n    try:\n        cookie_header = get_browser_cookies(url)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n        exit(1)\n\n    # Set headers with cookies for authenticated requests\n    session.headers.update({\n        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0',\n        'Cookie': cookie_header\n    })\n    return session\n\n# Main Execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    # ERDDAP login URL (through Google login)\n    login_url = \"https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/loginGoogle.html\"\n    \n    # ERDDAP data URL (direct link to dataset in .nc format)\n    data_url = [YOUR_ERDDAP_DATASET_URL]\n    \n    # Step 1: Authenticate Session\n    session = authenticate_session(login_url)\n\n    # Step 2: Download the data file and save as YOUR FILENAME\n    download_data(session, data_url, [FILENAME])\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Usage\n\nInstall Required Libraries: Make sure requests, selenium, and webdriver_manager are installed.\nSet Login URL and Data URL:\n\nThe login_url is the ERDDAP login page (usually loginGoogle.html for Google login).\nThe data_url points to the specific dataset you want to download.\n\nRun the Script:\n\nRun the script to open Chrome, log in to ERDDAP, retrieve cookies, and download the specified dataset.\nAdjust time.sleep(60) in get_browser_cookies to allow enough time for login if needed.\n\n\n\n\nUsage Notes\n\nBrowser and Driver Compatibility: Ensure that ChromeDriver is compatible with your installed Chrome version. webdriver_manager handles this automatically, but Chrome must be installed.\nAlternative Browsers: This guide uses Chrome for simplicity, but Firefox and Edge are also supported with minor adjustments to the code.\nError Handling: The script checks if cookies were successfully retrieved. If not, it suggests potential issues."
